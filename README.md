# Introduction

The Snake Game is a popular arcade game that was first introduced in the late 1970s. The goal of the game is to navigate a snake to eat food while avoiding obstacles and the snake's own tail. With each piece of food eaten, the snake grows longer, making the game progressively more challenging.
